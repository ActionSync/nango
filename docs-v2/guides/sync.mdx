In this guide, we show you how to sync data from external APIs with Nango.

<Tip>
To use the Nango Proxy, you should have set up an Integration and created a Connection already (cf. [API Authorization Guide](/guides/oauth)).
</Tip>

# Step 1: Initialize Nango

### Install Nango

To install the Nango CLI, run at the root of your project: 
```bash
npm i nango
```

<Tip>
	List all available CLI commands by running `npx nango`
</Tip>

### Create the `nango-integrations` folder

Still at the root of your project, if you don't have a `nango-integrations` folder yet, create one by running: 
```bash
npx nango init
```

<Tip>
**Understanding the `nango-integrations` folder**

Syncs have two parts:
- A config file called `nango.yaml`, which defines which Syncs exist, how often they should run, etc.
- A small typescript file per Sync, which defines the logic of the Sync

They all live in a folder called `nango-integrations` in your own code repository.

```txt nango-integrations structure
<YOUR-REPO>
    |
    nango-integrations
            |
            +- nango.yaml
            +- github-issues.ts
            +- asana-tasks.ts
            ...
```

Our CLI helps you manage this directory, create scaffolds, validates the configuration, etc.
</Tip>

### Run Nango

Start Nango locally: 

```bash
npx nango dev
```

<Tip>
    The initial start can take some time while the database is setup. 

	`npx nango dev` runs Nango and automatically watches for changes in your files and recompiles as needed. Compilation errors are printed to the terminal.

	Once ready, you can access the dashboard at [http:localhost:3003](http:localhost:3003)
</Tip>

# Step 2: Create a Sync

### Configure your Sync in `nango.yaml`

Open the `nango.yaml` file inside the `nango-integrations` folder and inspect its field:
```yaml nango.yaml
integrations:
	asana-dev: # Integration name (must match an Integration name in the Integrations tab of your Nango dashboard).
		asana-tasks: # Arbitrary Sync name
			runs: every 30min # Sync frequency
			return:
				- AsanaTask # Data model (defined below) as returned by your Sync script

models: 
	AsanaTask: # Data model referenced above
		id: string # Required unique ID
        project_id: string
        name: string
        completed: boolean
        created_at: date
        modified_at: date
```

<Tip>
	Possible model types include `string`, `boolean`, `number`, `date`, `null` as well as arrays & nested objects. Union types can be used with `|`.
</Tip>

Nango uses the models you define in `nango.yaml` to provide type safety when:
- you write Sync scripts
- Sync scripts run
- you fetch the synced data

Syncs and data models can be combined at will:
- A Sync can return multiple data models: e.g. `AsanaTasks` and `AsanaComments`
- Multiple Syncs can return the same data model: e.g. Asana and Linear can both return a `Task`

This lets you easily **create your own unified API** with standard data models tailored to your needs.

### Write your Sync

Modify the configuration of `nango.yaml` as you need and run: 
```
npx nango generate
```

This will generate the scaffold for your Sync script(s). Open any Sync script (named `[sync-name].ts`) which contains the following template (for the Asana example above): 

```typescript asana-tasks.ts
import { NangoSync } from 'nango';
import { AsanaTask } from './models';

export default async function fetchData(nango: NangoSync): Promise<{AsanaTask: AsanaTask[]}> {
	// Integration code goes here.
}
```

Sync scripts mostly do 2 things. They: 
- incrementally fetch data from external APIs (with HTTP requests)
- transform the external data into the models that you defined in `nango.yaml`

This logic is defined by you so that you can build arbitrarily custom and complex integrations.

<Tip>
Your Sync scripts are deployed to Nango and automatically run on a schedule. 

For local development, Nango runs your Sync scripts on your local machine. In production, your Sync scripts are deployed remotely and run on the Nango Cloud.

Because of this, you cannot import dependencies in the Sync scripts nor declare relative imports (we plan to resolve this limitation in the near future).
</Tip>

Fill in the `fetchData` method with your integration code:

```ts asana-taks.ts
import { NangoSync } from 'nango';
import { AsanaTask } from './models';

export default async function fetchData(nango: NangoSync): Promise<{AsanaTask: AsanaTask[]}> {

    // Get the user's workspaces & projects
    // For testing we just get the first project of the first workspace
    const workspaces = await paginate(nango, '/api/1.0/workspaces');
    const workspace = workspaces[0];

    const projects = await paginate(nango, '/api/1.0/projects', { workspace: workspace.gid });
    const project = projects[0];

    // Get all tasks for the project
    const filters = {
        project: project.gid,
        opt_fields: 'name,completed,created_at,modified_at'
    }
    const tasks = await paginate(nango, '/api/1.0/tasks', filters);
    let mappedTasks: AsanaTask[] = [];

    for (let task of tasks) {

        mappedTasks.push({
            id: task.gid,
            project_id: project.gid,
            name: task.name,
            completed: task.completed,
            created_at: task.created_at,
            modified_at: task.modified_at
        });

        if (mappedTasks.length > 49) {
            await nango.batchSend(mappedTasks, 'AsanaTask');
            mappedTasks = [];
        }
    }

    return { AsanaTask: mappedTasks };
}

async function paginate(nango: NangoSync, endpoint: string, queryParams?: Record<string, string|string[]>) {
    const MAX_PAGE = 100;
    let results: any[] = [];
    let page = null;
    let callParams = queryParams || {};
    while (true) {

        if (page) {
            callParams['offset'] = `${page}`;
        }

        const resp = await nango.get({
            endpoint: endpoint,
            params: {
                limit: `${MAX_PAGE}`,
                ...callParams
            }
        });

        results = results.concat(resp.data.data);

        if (resp.data.next_page) {
            page = resp.data.next_page.offset;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return results;
}
```

Sync scripts return the created/update data to Nango in two different ways: 
- all at once, at the end of the script, with `return { ModelName: data };` (for small datasets)
- in batches, using `await nango.batchSend(data, 'ModelName');` (useful to break down large datasets)

<Tip>
To make API requests use the proxy exposed by `nango` ([full docs](/sdks/node#direct-requests)).
    - `nango.get({})`
    - `nango.post({})`
    - etc
</Tip>

<Tip>
The 1st run of the Sync is called a "full", meaning it fetches all the historical data (unless you have defined a backfill limit in the Sync script). On the 1st run, `nango.lastSyncDate` will be `null`.

Subsequent runs are called "incremental". They should only fetch the created & updated data. It's up to you to use the `nango.lastSyncDate` value to fetch the incremental changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `await nango.log()` to log data from within integration scripts.
</Tip>

### Test your Sync

Easily test your sync with the CLI by running:

```bash
npx nango sync:run -p asana-dev -s asana-tasks -c <user-id>
```

This will only execute a dry run of the Sync. Synced objects will not be persisted in Nango's storage. It allows you to quickly check if your Sync script is correct.

<Tip>
To test incremental Sync runs, populate the `nango.lastSyncDate` value by adding the `-l` flag: 
```bash
npx nango sync:run -p asana-dev -s asana-tasks -c <user-id> -l "2023-06-20T10:00:00.000Z"
```
</Tip>

# Step 3: Deploy a Sync

Finally, if all looks good you can deploy your sync locally:

```bash
npx nango deploy:local
```

or to Nango Cloud: 

```bash
npx nango deploy:cloud
```

<Tip>
Syncs will automatically start when a new Connection gets added (OAuth flow completes). You can see all Syncs for a Connection in the UI:

![View Syncs in Dashboard](/images/connection-syncs.png)
</Tip>

# Step 4: Retrieve the synced data

Fetch the always-fresh data from the Sync in your backend with the [backend SDK](/sdks) or the [REST API](/api-reference):

```ts Node SDK example for Nango Cloud
import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<SECRET-KEY>' });

const result = await nango.getRecords({
    providerConfigKey: 'asana-dev',
    connectionId: '<user-id>',
    model: 'AsanaTask'
});
```

Nango can also send you [webhook](/nango-sync/webhooks) whenever new data is available from a sync.

That's it!
