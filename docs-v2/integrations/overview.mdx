Nango Auth & Sync can work with **any** external API.

100+ of them have pre-configured [templates](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) with:

-   auth
-   sync
-   assisted requests (pre-filled domain & headers)
-   rate-limiting
-   pagination

Missing an [Integration Template](/core-concepts#integration-templates)? Either:

-   ask for it in the [community](https://nango.dev/slack), we can build it in &lt;48h
-   [contribute it](/contribute), it's fast & easy, and we are here to [help](https://nango.dev/slack)
